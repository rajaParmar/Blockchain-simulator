Seed Node:
1) We have created a single seed node.
2)  We are opening it on a fixed port no. 46680 so that we can hard code it in clients. In the case that the port number 46680 (which is highly 
unlikely) we will print the message to close the port and exit from seed.
3)IP address of the seed node should be provided explicitly in the client.py program.
4)Seed node provides a string comprising of IP addresses and Port numbers of the clients connected to it.
Format: "-IPAddress1@Portnumber1-IPAddress2@Portnumber2"  is the information sent to third client requesting information

Client Node:

1)Client node first connects to the seed node and in return gets a list of all IP addresses and Port numbers currently connected in the p2p 
network.
2)From the list of these peers currently in the network. it will choose the MIN(4, number of peers) to form  socket for gossipping. We are
 choosing the last 4 nodes in the seed list to make p2p connection.
3)Client starts a new thread for message creation and loops indefinitely for hearing and writing gossips.
4) For implementing nework delays, we are creaing messages at random inervals of 5-10 seconds.

Message is printed in output.txt(in append mode), on stdout and gossiped to connected peers.
Commands:
1) for running a seed node :
shell >  python3 seed.py 
2) for running a client node :
shell> python3 client.py <IP-address of seed node>
